* Conditional statements

** What are conditional statements
    - are language constructs that perform different actions based on certain conditions
    
** Four key conditional statements (types of conditional statements)

*** IF statement
    - contains only one simple or complex condition

**** simple condition
    #+begin_src python
      if age < 10: 
	print("Is under 10") # will only be printed if the condition is true
    #+end_src
    
**** complex condition
    #+begin_src python
      
      if age > 10 and age < 18:
	print("Is between ages 10 and 18") # will only be printed if the condition is true
    #+end_src
    

*** IF-ELSE statement
    - an if statement that has an 'else' statement under
    - has two conditions

**** example
    #+begin_src python
      # The code under 'else' will only run if the condition defined in the 'if' was not met
      if age > 10 and age < 18:
	print("Is between ages 10 and 18")
      else:
	print("unknown category")
    #+end_src

*** IF-ELIF-ELSE statement
    - a conditional statement that contains three or more conditions
      #+begin_src python
        if age > 10 and age < 18:
	  print("Is between ages 10 and 18")
        elif age < 10:
	  print("Is a baby")
        else:
	  print("unknown category")
      #+end_src

*** Nested if statements
    - are if statements inside if statements
      #+begin_src python
	if fruit == "Apple":
	  if fruit.state == "rotten":
	    print("you can't eat this!!!")
	  else:
	    print("eat it! It's good for you")
      #+end_src

** Conditional Operators
*** == (equal)
*** != (not equal)
*** > (greater than)
*** < (less than)
*** >= (greater than or equal)
*** <= (less than or equal)
